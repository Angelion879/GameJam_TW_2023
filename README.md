# GameJam_TW_2023
First hings first, WELCOME to our official Game Jam Repo. I'll start off by giving some instructions, so we can all be on the same page for friday (02/06).

# 1 step - Accounts
Our game shall be submitted to a site called itch.io in order to us to compete in the game jam. This site is a cool place for indie developers and creators to share content about game development and even their new indie games.
Being aware of that, I must ask all of you to create an account there. I have created one myself a while ago (this is my profile: https://angelion879.itch.io) and if you need any help with it, dont hesitate on calling me!

# 2 step - Enviroment

 - In order to develop, we will need...?
 - A pact with some Eldrich God and a blood sacrifice?
 - ... Almost. Unity.
 - THAT'S LITERALLY THE SAME THING!

Yup, we will need Unity. But don't you worry, my fellow adventurer, for I will walk through the valley of death by your side!
To start things up, please download UnityHub [https://unity.com/download], it will make the setup much easier!
